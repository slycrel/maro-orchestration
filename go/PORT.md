# Maro Go Port — exploration branch

Jeremy, 2026-08-21: *"Let's go nuts and pivot for a while. Let's make a
branch and port maro to golang."* (Clarified same session: a
long-considered exploration in its own right — *"Worst case we learn
nothing and waste some tokens."*) The Python runtime at the repo root
**remains production**; this directory is the experiment.

## Doctrine — port the lessons, not just the code

The Python codebase enforces its hard-won invariants with tripwires
(AST scanners, registries, pin tests) because Python can't stop the bug
class at the point of writing. The port's bet is that Go can make some
of them **structural**:

| Python lesson (how it's enforced there) | Go shape here |
|---|---|
| Caps are data-driven or they go; every override needs a written why (`test_budget_override_discipline.py` registry) | `budget.Budget{Name, Limit, Why}` — the rationale is a field; a package test fails on any empty `Why` |
| No silent truncation — cuts must be marked (`context_budget.clip` + slice census) | `budget.Clip` is the only shortening idiom; marker byte-identical to Python's so records interoperate |
| No swallowed errors (`except: pass` audits) | errors are returned or recorded; a failed step carries its real reason into the failure chain |
| The resolved store is part of the result (2026-08-16 live-ledger incident) | `record.New(workspaceDir)` takes the store as an argument; `cmd/maro` prints the resolved workspace before any write |
| Data retention: append-only, never auto-delete | `record` has no delete/rotate/compact verbs at all |
| Named agentic seams (`purpose=` on every call) | `llm.Options.Purpose` is on every call site |

## On-disk compatibility

Same workspace resolution as Python `config.workspace_root`, name for
name and in the same order (`MARO_WORKSPACE` > `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE` >
`WORKSPACE_ROOT` > `~/.maro/workspace`; `MARO_USER_DIR` moves only the
user-config tier, and **there is no MARO_HOME** — the 2026-08-16
live-ledger incident variable stays unread). Same record files, same
shapes:

- `memory/outcomes.jsonl` — compatible key subset;
  `measurement_class: "go-port"` fences Go rows in analyses. `cost_usd`
  is deliberately absent (no estimator ported; missing ≠ zero).
- `memory/captains_log.jsonl` — `{timestamp, event_type, subject,
  summary, audience, context, loop_id}`.
- Appends take the same advisory flock on the same sibling
  `<file>.lock` files as Python `file_lock.locked_append` (fail-closed,
  torn-tail framing), so both runtimes can write one workspace without
  corrupting each other's rows.

dev-recall, the viz server, and the learning pipeline read both
runtimes' history through one lens.

## What v0 is (and is not)

**Ported and running (spine-first vertical slice):**

- `internal/config` — two-tier YAML (user < workspace), one-level-deep
  nested merge, env path overrides; parse failures are *reported*, never
  swallowed.
- `internal/budget` — the caps discipline (see doctrine).
- `internal/llm` — adapter seam + `claude` CLI subprocess backend
  (flag-for-flag with the Python adapter, stream-json result parsing)
  and Anthropic Messages API backend; scripted `Fake` for tests/dry-run.
- `internal/jsonx` — tolerant JSON extraction (fences, prose,
  brackets-inside-strings), strict about content (non-string steps
  error, never coerce).
- `internal/planner` — decompose with operator docs
  (GOALS/CONTEXT/SIGNALS.md) riding whole under the OperatorDoc budget.
- `internal/loop` — decompose → execute → record, prior-step evidence
  budgeted+marked, blocked reasons traveling whole.
- `cmd/maro` — `maro run "goal" [-max-steps N] [-backend ...] [-model X]`.

**Pack tranche (2026-08-22, "export then import success"):**

- `internal/pack` — the full maro-pack lifecycle: `export` (gather +
  scrub + REVIEW.md), `seal` (review-hash + payload-digest stamps),
  `import` (trust demotion per PORTABLE_LEARNING_DESIGN §3), `adopt`
  (quarantine → live with provenance frontmatter). CLI:
  `maro pack export|seal|import|adopt`.
- `internal/scrub` — secret_scrub.py port (secret shapes + known-local
  identifiers; the human review gate remains the real backstop).
- `internal/provenance` — the Tier-0 lesson-provenance classifier,
  re-applied at import so transport cannot launder a prompt-derived
  lesson into an injectable one (db37d525 class).
- `internal/knowledge` — the MINIMAL Python-schema store surface the
  importer lands in: hypotheses + medium-tier lessons, full asdict()
  field parity, plus the variant-union rewrite (identity collision
  skips the row, not its rationale).

**Cross-runtime proof** (`crossrt_smoke.sh`, run live 2026-08-22): the
full circle Python export → Go import → Go export → Python import
passes — each seal verified by the RECEIVING runtime's independent
recomputation of the canonical payload digest
(`json.dumps(sort_keys, separators=(",",":"), ensure_ascii=False)`
reproduced byte-for-byte in `canonical.go`, pinned against
CPython-generated fixtures), trust demoted at every hop
(contested-by-birth compounds: `imported-xrt-go-imported-xrt-py-…`),
and Python's own loaders (`load_hypotheses`, `load_tiered_lessons`)
parse every Go-written row. The two runtimes also share the flock
protocol on `memory/.pack-import.lock`, so concurrent imports from
either runtime into one workspace serialize.

**Pack-tranche residuals, named:**

- `skill_records` quarantine to `imports/<label>/` instead of importing
  natively (outcome string `quarantined_no_native_skill_store_v1`) —
  this runtime has no skills store until the tools tranche; the rows
  are preserved verbatim, nothing is half-imported.
- `--include-runs` (Class E opt-in) and `--include-playbook`'s Python
  interactive-confirm shim are not ported; playbook export works via
  the flag, runs export does not exist yet.
- Rules/hypotheses lanes share Python's intra-artifact behavior of
  deduping by id but not adding each imported TEXT to the identity
  snapshot mid-artifact (lessons do; the asymmetry is upstream's —
  kept bug-for-bug so transport semantics stay identical, worth fixing
  in BOTH runtimes together).
- The import-side classifier gets (lesson, source_goal) only, like
  Python's import call site — the evidence leg is a mint-time-only
  signal in both runtimes.

**Pack adversarial round (2026-08-22, 4 lenses, sonnet-medium fallback)
— fixed here, plus divergences deliberately kept and named:**

Go is now STRICTER than Python on several hostile shapes (all
refusal-direction, so no legitimate Python-produced pack is affected;
each is a candidate to backport to `src/pack.py`): decompression bounds
on untrusted archives (64MB/member, 256MB total, 4096 members — Python's
tarfile path is still unbounded); refusal of invalid-UTF-8 members and
lone-surrogate `\u` escapes in pack.json (Python crashes loudly on the
same input, Go's decoders would have silently substituted U+FFFD);
manifest/archive bijection at both seal and import (duplicate manifest
paths, un-manifested stowaway members, and manifest rows with no archive
member are all refused — Python KeyErrors on the missing-member case but
silently carries stowaways and double-imports duplicate paths); rows
whose id field is absent, null, empty, or composite (array/object) are
reported `malformed_skipped` — scalar ids (number/bool) are coerced to
Python's `str()` form and import at parity (r2 correction: Python's
f-string imports `{"rule_id": 42}` fine; only ABSENT/empty ids collapse
onto one shared `imported-<pack>-` identity there, silently eaten as
`already_imported`, and Python stringifies null/composites into junk
ids); `pack_format`
that is present but not a valid integer is a hard refusal (Python
TypeErrors — closed, but as a crash).

Behavior ported to parity in the same round: the
`knowledge.provenance_gate_enabled` killswitch (ambient config, string
"false"/"0"/"no"/"off" normalized; the incoming-stamp quarantine path
stays outside the gate, as in Python), the adopt audit row + full report
shape (`label`/`adopted_at`/`dry_run`), and `AbsorbVariant` re-ported
line-for-line (strip both sides, unicode-aware trim, pre- AND post-clip
identity checks).

Named textual divergences accepted (degenerate input only, no safety
effect): `asString` renders a JSON array as `[a b]` where Python's
`str()` gives `"['a', 'b']"`; RE2's `\b` is ASCII-only where Python's is
unicode-aware, so a non-ASCII username/hostname in the scrub denylist
could bound differently across runtimes (identifiers on this box are
ASCII; the human review gate is the backstop). Canonical-digest numbers:
Go preserves `json.Number` literals verbatim while Python re-normalizes
through `json.loads`/`dumps` — identical for every machine-written
manifest, divergent (→ digest mismatch → refusal) for hand-crafted
non-canonical literals; pinned by test, documented in `canonical.go`.
CLI drift: Go uses flags (`-pack`, `-name`) where Python's `maro-pack`
uses positionals, and Go has no `export --seal` one-shot and no
interactive confirm (missing `-yes` refuses rather than prompts).

Round 3 (fix-layer review, 2 lenses) additions: a decompressor-level
byte ceiling now sits BETWEEN gzip and tar, so PAX/GNU meta records the
stdlib consumes inside `tr.Next()` (1MiB each, unbounded in count,
invisible to the entry cap) are bounded categorically; JSONL rows decode
with UseNumber so numeric ids keep their source literal exactly (a
float64 round-trip diverged >2^53 ids from Python's arbitrary-precision
str() and let crafted neighbors collide); report rows come out in file
order (the r2 callback emitted malformed rows first); a malformed id's
report value is always a string. Note on null/composite ids: Python's
f-string stringifies those into junk ids and imports them — Go's
refusal is a deliberate over-refusal (safe direction), not parity.

Round 2 (fix-layer review, 2 lenses) additions: non-regular tar entries
(dirs/symlinks/devices) and duplicate member names are refused outright
and EVERY header counts against the entry cap (the r1 bounds skipped
non-regular headers before any cap — a decompress-loop bypass);
lone-surrogate escapes are refused per-row in JSONL content, not just
pack.json; Import refuses `pack.json`/`REVIEW.md` listed as artifacts
(matching Seal); explicit `provenance_gate_enabled: null` keeps the
gate ON in Go where Python's `bool(None)` turns it OFF (pinned, safe
direction).

**Executor tranche (2026-08-22, tool-bearing worker steps):**

`maro run` now defaults to the EXECUTOR lane on the subprocess backend
(`-safe` opts back into utility mode; the dry backend never requests it):

- Two subprocess lanes, matching Python's `no_tools` split: utility keeps
  `--tools ""` + a `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=16000` runaway brake;
  executor enables the CLI's own tools with `--disallowedTools
  WebFetch,WebSearch`, binds cwd to the run's project dir
  (`<workspace>/projects/<slug>/`), and caps per-tool-call Bash
  output via `BASH_MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH` with Python
  `_bash_output_cap_env`'s full precedence — including the
  disable-means-UNSET-in-child semantics that Python's 2026-07-27 review
  paid for. The deny-list is a convenience, NOT an egress boundary: Bash
  stays enabled, so the worker can still fetch (curl, git). Python's
  actual boundary is the container lane (`executor.container`), which is
  unported — until then an exec run trusts the goal text the way any
  uncontained agent session does (adversarial exec review 2026-08-22,
  Skeptic; the old phrasing over-claimed).
- The simulated tool-call protocol (`_TOOL_INJECTION_TEMPLATE` verbatim,
  with the load-bearing "Never execute it" line): workers report via
  `complete_step` (result/summary/confidence/inject_steps) or
  `flag_stuck` (reason/attempted); no parseable tool call falls back to
  content-as-result (Python parity). Parsing is strict (whole-span,
  UseNumber, trailing data refused); `llm.ParseToolCall` is invoked at
  the loop's call site, not inside the adapter — a named divergence:
  Python parses adapter-side because its API backends have native
  tool_use; Go grows that when one is ported.
- Plan mutation: `inject_steps` splices at the FRONT of the queue
  (Python `remaining_steps[:0]`), capped 3/step, each clipped by a
  registered budget (`injected-step`, 500); total executed steps are
  capped at 2× the planned count — an honest stand-in for Python's
  `max_iterations` machinery (adaptive bumping not ported); exhaustion
  marks the run stuck with the remainder NAMED (step contents, not a
  count) in the failure chain. Worker-injected steps carry a
  `WasInjected` tag all the way to the CLI's step printout — plan
  mutation is visible in the delivered output, not only in records.
- Project-dir resolution is the full `resolve_project_slug` port:
  naive 5-word slugs collide on generic openers ("tell me about
  the…"), so an existing dir with a generic slug and a DIFFERENT
  recorded mission disambiguates via `-2`…`-20` suffixes, then a goal-
  hash fallback (returned unchecked — Python parity); same mission
  re-enters its dir (continuity), specific slugs reuse without
  ceremony, and a reuse decided on WEAK evidence (no recorded mission,
  phrasing-only tails) is warned, never silent. Named divergence:
  Python reads the recorded mission from NEXT.md's goal line; Go
  records a `.mission` file at project creation — written
  full-content-then-`link(2)` so first-writer-wins holds atomically
  WITH its content (a crash mid-write must not leave an empty file
  that reads as "no evidence" forever) — and FALLS BACK to parsing a
  Python-written NEXT.md `> goal` line, because the runtimes share one
  workspace format and the guard must not be blind on the interop side
  (adversarial exec r2, Skeptic). Without all this, two unrelated runs
  silently share a live project dir and the second worker acts on the
  first's files — all four r1 lenses flagged it.
- Disambiguation only settles SEQUENTIAL collisions; the CONCURRENT
  case is closed by the ported admission gate (`loop/slot.go`, Python
  `acquire_project_slot`): a per-project flock at
  `<workspace>/memory/loop-<slug>.lock`, claimed before the first
  project write, held for the run, refuse-immediately on busy (the
  refusal records a stuck outcome naming the holder), and fs errors
  degrade to UNGATED with a warning. A busy-refused run NEVER removes
  the project dir — the slot holder may be a racing winner that just
  created it and hasn't written .mission yet (Python never deletes on
  LoopBusy; the r3 review caught the r2 cleanup rmdir'ing the winner's
  still-empty dir). Live-fired (two concurrent same-goal real-CLI runs
  → one completed, one refused with holder metadata) AND pinned by an
  automated race-detector-clean concurrent-Run test.
  Unported, named in slot.go: `--wait` polling, in-process sibling
  slot sharing, the unlink/reacquire inode guard, busy_policy=worktree.
- The blocked-step LADDER (`loop/blocked.go`, Python `loop_blocked`'s
  Phase 62 zoom-metacognition algorithm) replaces the flat first-block
  halt: NEED_INFO spawns research-then-retry; a missing external input
  is an honest terminal (never retried, split, or FABRICATED — the
  fabricated-input false-success bug); combined exec+analyze steps get
  the structural split; timeouts get an LLM split (45s, heuristic
  sentence-boundary fallback) or an honest terminal; then
  convergence-aware retry (md5-fingerprint parity with Python, pinned
  against CPython fixtures; round-1 generic hint, round-2 LLM
  refinement hint threaded into the retry prompt with the RETRY
  REMINDER), sibling-failure-rate re-decomposition (>50% blocked with
  ≥3 executed, current attempt EXCLUDED from the evidence — Python
  decides before appending to step_outcomes; the ladder r1 review
  caught Go self-counting the just-blocked attempt, which fired
  premature redecompose on small plans), re-decompose via the planner
  (≤5 sub-steps, capped at
  2 replans), and a terminal verdict that halts with the reason, the
  stop verdict, and the unexecuted remainder NAMED. Since r2 the
  verdict and the whole stuck reason land in TYPED outcome columns
  (stop_verdict / stuck_reason — Python memory.record_outcome and the
  loop result dict), and the chain entry's verdict tag is appended
  AFTER the entry's single clip (marker-class): the chain text was the
  only carrier, and the 600-char entry clip could eat the tag and the
  do-not-fabricate instruction on exactly the long-reason runs that
  need them (r2, both lenses independently — this round's HIGH again
  sat in the previous round's fix). Thresholds verbatim (3 retries /
  0.5 sibling / 2 replans / 3-consecutive-ceiling-timeout adapter-hung
  bail). Every decision is recorded as a METACOGNITIVE_DECISION event
  with the evidence (retries, fingerprints, replan count, action). A
  recovered run is DONE with its blocked attempts still in the record.
  The tool-less lane keeps v0's run-through — deliberate asymmetry.
  Ladder r1 fix layer (adversarial, 4 lenses, sonnet-medium fallback):
  the INITIAL plan is shaped too (Python's label="initial-plan" pass —
  a combined exec+analyze step no longer burns a worker call before
  the reactive split sees it; r2 made it UNCONDITIONAL across both
  lanes like Python's _prepare_execution, and closed the fourth
  shaping surface — worker inject_steps, Python's label="inject");
  blocked outcomes carry a typed
  (StuckReason, Attempted) pair mirroring Python's separate
  stuck_reason/result fields, so the fingerprint gets independent
  200-char heads and the missing-input check reads BOTH signal sources
  (honest scope, named r2: the second signal is live for flag_stuck
  only — llm.ResultError has no partial-output carrier, so Python's
  killed-subprocess tail (step_exec.py:1659, last 2000 chars) is
  structurally unavailable until the adapter grows one);
  the MISSING_INPUT inner clip is Python's clip(reason, 1000) runaway
  bound, not the 600-char chain budget (which guaranteed the
  do-not-fabricate instruction fell off the assembled entry); the
  timeout-split and refinement-hint calls return their token usage into
  the run totals (with the failed-call ResultError salvage); a
  successful step resets the consecutive-timeout streak (Python
  loop_execute.py:1884 — without it, non-consecutive timeouts
  accumulated to a false adapter-hung bail); split/redecompose children
  of a worker-injected step keep the WasInjected audit mark. All six
  fixes carry mutation-verified must-detect pins.
  Unported ladder pieces, named: token_runaway abandonment (no ingest
  brake), escape-pattern demotion hints (step_exec detectors), mid-loop
  diagnosis consult (introspect, Phase 44), navigator shadow, per-role
  model routing for split/hint calls, retry model-tier escalation
  (loop_blocked.py:235-242 cheap→mid→power via step_tier_overrides —
  Go has no model-tier registry; retries re-run on the same adapter),
  the pending_context injection
  seam (hints ride the step prompt), boundary/recon tag guards in step
  shaping, mid-loop iteration-budget bump (the 2× cap stays the outer
  breaker — binding on small plans: for a 1-step plan the cap is 2, so
  the 3-retry threshold is structurally unreachable there; Python's
  max_iterations=40 + one-time 50% bump machinery is what actually
  gives the ladder room). Known shared-key risk, inherited from Python:
  stepRetries/stepFingerprints key by literal step text, so two plan
  positions with byte-identical text (e.g. two splits both falling back
  to the generic analysis clause) share retry/fingerprint state.
- Memory RECALL (`internal/recall` + the retrieval half of
  `internal/knowledge`) — the loop reads what the system already knows
  before it plans. `recall.Recall` is the seam (recall.py's contract):
  read-only — STRICTER than Python here: even the times_applied
  receipt write-back is unported, so the Go seam writes nothing —
  and every failure degrades to "knows nothing", with degradations
  NAMED in the instrumentation sources (`error_*`,
  `lessons_skipped_rows`) instead of swallowed. Two substrates ported:
  - **Ranked tiered lessons**: `LoadTieredLessons` reads
    `memory/<tier>/lessons.jsonl` with Python's read-time decay
    derivation (effective = stored × 0.85^days since last_reinforced,
    MEDIUM only — LONG is promoted-permanent; stored scores never
    rewritten, which would compound decay), the per-row parse guard
    (one malformed/byte-torn/type-drifted row skips THAT row and
    counts it — never the tier; numeric fields coerced inside the
    guard exactly where Python's r3/r4 of the store-hardening arc put
    them), and min_score compared AFTER decay, skipped entirely on
    raw loads (Python's `not raw` ordering). `QueryLessonsScored`
    pools LONG+MEDIUM over the FULL store (limit=None — relevance is
    the ranker's job), drops provisional / quarantined
    (minted_from=="prompt", the db37d525 provenance gate) / contested
    rows, and ranks with the TF-IDF cosine ranker
    (`TFIDFRankScored`) — tokenizer, log-IDF, norm-or-1.0 cosine, and
    the 0.90 citation penalty pinned against CPython-computed fixtures
    to 1e-9, ties keeping input order (Python's stable sort). Parity
    quirk kept deliberately: a no-signal query returns ALL lessons in
    input order at 0.0, topK ignored — only the caller bounds it.
    Selection mirrors recall.py's chunk-6 rewire: agenda-typed top 3
    from a 10-wide scored window, untyped tiered top-up deduped by
    lesson_id. The render is the receipts block ("## Lessons from
    Prior Runs", ✓/✗ by outcome, "reinforced Nx / N sessions /
    applied Nx" or the honest "(observed once)") under the
    1200-char LessonInject budget as a whole-line BREAKER — never a
    mid-line truncation (caps decree 2026-08-21) — with
    cited-only-if-rendered (a dropped line's id never enters
    lesson_ids_cited; the contradiction join must not contest lessons
    the run never saw).
  - **Prior attempts**: `FindPriorAttempts` scans
    `runs/<dir>/metadata.json` newest-first (mtime, cap 200 —
    O(recent activity)), matching exact / near (word-overlap Jaccard
    ≥ 0.9, `_text_similarity` parity) / project, with SF-2 tri-state
    goal_achieved and the §13b status-derived external-interrupt
    fallback (interrupted/stranded/refused_busy/clarification_needed
    carry no goal evidence). The as_context_block summary paragraph
    (status breakdown, verdict counts, interrupted count,
    do-not-repeat instruction) rides under the RecallContext budget
    with Python's 64-char marker reserve.
  Both blocks reach the INITIAL `planner.Decompose` as system-prompt
  extras in Python's extras order (ancestry before lessons,
  planner.py:962) — the same two channels Python feeds decompose
  (lessons_context via loop_planning, the attempts summary via
  handle.py's as_context_block → ancestry_context). Redecompose/split
  calls deliberately get no recall block, like Python. The read is
  instrumented as a RECALL_PERFORMED captain's-log event before
  LOOP_STARTED; emission lives at the loop call site because the Go
  seam keeps no recorder handle (named divergence — Python emits from
  inside recall()); an event-write failure is held and lands in
  Result.Warnings or, when decompose also dies, the failure chain.
  Unported recall substrates, named (recall.py carries eight):
  standing rules, decision journal, graveyard resurrection (the one
  Python side effect — resurrect=True un-decays), failure notes,
  learning activity, playbook, knowledge nodes, thread identity
  (origin walk + ancestry.json), prior-decision briefs (run_card
  curation), project_artifacts inventory, dispatch_signals,
  portability re-weighting (§14a), camera frames, age stamps, the
  legacy flat-store top-up + fallback injector, magic-prefix stripping
  at the match boundary (a Python run recorded under a prefixed
  prompt can miss the near-match here), hybrid BM25/RRF ranking
  (`_USE_HYBRID`, optional rank-bm25 dep — TF-IDF is Python's own
  always-available fallback, so both runtimes share this floor), and
  max-age pruning at the query layer. The Go runtime also does not
  WRITE `runs/<dir>/metadata.json` yet, so prior attempts surface only
  in a workspace shared with Python — a pure-Go workspace honestly
  degrades to zero priors. Go-stricter divergences, refusal-direction:
  type-drifted STRING fields skip the row (Python's duck-typed
  dataclass carries them until they explode inside the ranker);
  byte-invalid rows are refused before decode (Go's encoding/json
  would otherwise launder invalid UTF-8 into U+FFFD — the corruption
  signal loads_clean exists to preserve); NON-FINITE numeric strings
  ("NaN"/"Infinity" — both strconv.ParseFloat and Python float()
  accept them) fail the row and are counted, because a NaN score
  survives every MinScore filter (`NaN < x` is always false) uncounted
  (r1 Skeptic); Python-truthiness is kept where it is load-bearing
  (`provisional: "false"` is truthy and stays filtered;
  a type-drifted truthy `evidence_sources` value stays CITED via a
  one-element carrier — the shape-only assertion silently applied the
  0.90 penalty Python would not, r1 Skeptic + Expert QA
  independently). Container fields with NO ranking consumer
  (imported/canon/delta_evidence/grounding/merged_variants) coerce to
  empty on shape drift without failing the row — behavior-inert
  today; a future consumer of those fields must revisit that choice.
  Recall r1 fix layer (adversarial, 4 lenses, sonnet-medium
  fallback): LoadOptions' zero value now means UNLIMITED — the
  Limit<0-for-unlimited draft made `LoadOptions{}` silently return an
  empty result set indistinguishable from an empty store (the round's
  HIGH; zero value must degrade to "everything", never "nothing");
  Recall carries a recover() folding an unanticipated panic into
  Sources["error_recall_panic"] (the Go stand-in for Python's
  per-substrate except blankets — this seam eats hand-editable data
  and must never crash a run); ContextBlock ports the 2026-08-14
  degenerate-budget floor WITH the subtraction (limit-64 ≤ 0 would
  hit Clip's breaker-off path and return unbounded text); the
  metadata-scan cap comment states honestly that it bounds only the
  read phase (the listing+stat phase is O(lifetime runs) in BOTH
  runtimes — inherited, needs a shared index to fix); prior-attempt
  ordering is a lexical sort on raw started_at, byte-for-byte
  Python's — known-preserved misordering across heterogeneous
  timestamp shapes. Further named after r1: the tiered-store
  QUARANTINE SIDECAR (_quarantine_unparseable) is unported —
  LoadTieredLessons is a pure READER and must not be reused as the
  read half of a rebuild-style rewrite (reinforce/promote/GC) until
  the sidecar lands, or skipped rows would be destroyed on rewrite
  (the exact Python incident the sidecar closed; the existing
  UnionVariantsIntoLesson is line-in-place and preserves undecodable
  rows, so it is not exposed); the lesson-render icon drops Python's
  SF-2 goal_achieved-preferred branch — dead code in Python today (no
  writer stamps goal_achieved on tiered rows) and TieredLesson has no
  such field here, so wiring it up in Python requires a synchronized
  Go patch; readers of lessons.jsonl take no flock in either runtime
  (writers do) — safe while every writer is a single write() or an
  atomic rename; LoadOptions' Raw/MaxAgeDays/LessonType surface and
  FindPriorAttempts' windowHours/excludeHandleID/project parameters
  are Python-parity surface with no production Go caller yet
  (unit-tested only; the project lane is dead on the CLI path until
  project threading lands pre-decompose).
  Recall r2 fix layer (adversarial, 2 lenses, sonnet-medium
  fallback): the r1 citedness fix had an unfixed WRITER sibling —
  pack import's shape-only `.([]any)` assertion PERSISTED drifted
  truthy evidence as `[]`, making the row permanently uncited (the
  read-side fix could never help a row the write side already
  flattened; both lenses found it independently, and it is the
  flagship pattern's 11th instance — the round's top finding sat
  inside the previous round's fix). One owner now:
  knowledge.CoerceEvidenceSources is the single truthiness-preserving
  coercion, called by the tiered reader AND the pack importer, with a
  round-trip pin (TestImportPreservesCitednessThroughTypeDrift).
  Also from r2: the recover now captures debug.Stack() under a new
  PanicTrace budget (a bare panic value with no trace is
  un-actionable; a panicHook test seam proves the recover fires and
  that pre-panic partial results survive); FindPriorAttempts returns
  a skipped count surfaced as Sources["prior_attempts_skipped"]
  (malformed run metadata was silently invisible — same
  short-read-vs-short-store honesty rule as the lesson loader);
  truthy(json.Number) parse-failure fails OPEN to truthy (the
  conservative direction for provisional/contested gates — pinned);
  the ContextBlock degenerate floor and the happy-path event-failure
  warning each gained the executing test their prose claimed.
  Named accepted (r2): with Limit<=0 as unlimited there is no way to
  request literally zero rows — acceptable because no caller wants an
  empty read from a retrieval API (comment on LoadOptions).
  Recall r3 fix layer (adversarial, 1 QA lens, sonnet-medium
  fallback): the r2 fix generalized the MECHANISM for the one named
  field but not the RULE across the function — one field below the
  citedness rewire, `provisional` was still a shape-only `.(bool)`
  read, so `"provisional": "true"` imported as TRUSTED and sailed
  past the recall-time provisional gate (trust escalation, strictly
  worse than the 0.90 penalty the r2 fix closed; flagship pattern
  instance #12). knowledge.Truthy is now EXPORTED as the boolean
  half of the boundary rule (CoerceEvidenceSources is the container
  half): every gate-feeding value crossing the pack-import boundary
  preserves Python truthiness, not JSON shape, with round-trip pins
  for both directions of drift. Also from r3: the panic VALUE is
  clipped separately (new PanicValue budget, 500) before joining the
  stack under PanicTrace, so a payload-carrying panic value cannot
  crowd the stack — the actionable half — out of the budget; the
  panicHook seam carries a no-t.Parallel() comment (unsynchronized
  by design, single production caller).
  Recall r4 (adversarial, 1 Skeptic lens, sonnet-medium fallback —
  the CONVERGENCE round: no HIGH, no production-code defect).
  Operational note (r4 MED): any pack imported by a pre-51377350 Go
  build persisted drifted provisional flags as a durable
  `"provisional": false` — indistinguishable on disk from a
  legitimately trusted row, and not repairable after the fact
  (the original string was overwritten). Re-import such packs with a
  current build. No deployment is affected today: the Go port is
  pre-production by decree and no pre-fix Go importer ran outside
  this branch's own tests. Accepted-named (r4): pack import's
  human_reviewed read stays a shape-only .(bool) — BOTH writers emit
  native booleans and the failure direction is the safe one (a
  forged string fails the assertion and the pack is REFUSED, not
  trusted; fail-closed is correct for a review gate, so routing it
  through Truthy would be a step backward); the panicHook
  no-t.Parallel() constraint stays comment-grade until the seam
  grows a second caller.
- A run whose project-dir setup fails still records a stuck outcome
  carrying the planning spend before erroring out; a transcript file
  that cannot be created degrades to the deleted-temp capture with a
  warning rather than failing the step — an OS error must not
  fabricate a "blocked" record blaming the model.
- Long-running step classification ported (keyword sets verbatim,
  `MARO_LONG_RUNNING_TIMEOUT`, full-suite ×2 capped at 3600s); executor
  default timeout 600s like Python's adapter default.
- Per-step transcripts: the merged stream-json capture persists to
  `<project>/artifacts/step-N-transcript.jsonl` (artifacts-over-streams;
  kept on success AND failure, never deleted by the adapter).
- Capability is structural: the named `llm.AgentToolsCapable` interface
  (one type, asserted by every reader); a requested exec run on an
  incapable backend degrades to the tool-less path WITH a warning
  (never silently), and the `-model` CLI wrapper forwards the
  capability (interface embedding would otherwise strip it). The CLI
  decides exec ONCE from the constructed adapter's capability and
  prints the entered mode plainly (`exec mode: ON/off — …`) — default-
  on tool-bearing execution is the run's highest-blast-radius property
  and must be visible without reading code.
- `EXECUTE_SYSTEM` ported as the sections whose machinery exists here
  (synchronous-execution, anti-hallucination, NEED_INFO, URL-fetch
  discipline, file-edit protocol, token efficiency). Deliberately
  dropped, because advertising a silently-dropped field is worse than
  omitting it: artifacts, decisions, world_facts channels,
  ask-may-be-wrong, also-noticed, pre-fetched-URL block,
  create_team_worker, step-type classification/prompt extras
  (data-pipeline, artifact-materialize, long-lived-process,
  recon-flavor). Each returns with its consumer.

Unported from Python's executor lane, named: container wrap
(`executor.container`), executor sessions + fork-master, token-runaway
brake, constraint tiers/HITL gates, URL pre-fetch, worker push guard
(`missing_write_targets`), tool-pathology classification, per-step model
routing/trajectory escalation.

**Deliberately NOT ported yet (next tranches, in rough order of value):**

1. ~~Memory recall + knowledge injection~~ — ranked-lesson +
   prior-attempt slice DONE (recall tranche above); playbook, edges,
   and the other named substrates return with their consumers.
2. Closure verification / quality gate.
3. Director, intent routing, NOW-vs-AGENDA lanes.
4. Inspector/evolver self-improvement loop.
5. Heartbeat, projects, escalation, notifications, viz.

**Named smaller gaps, accepted for v0** (adversarial round 2026-08-22 —
4 lenses, sonnet-medium fallback; each of these was flagged and either
fixed or parked here honestly):

- Subprocess liveness/stall kill: only the wall-clock timeout exists;
  Python `_run_subprocess_safe`'s mtime/CPU-stall detection is not
  ported. Output capture is disk-backed, so memory stays bounded.
- `cost_usd` estimation: rows omit the field rather than lie `0.0`.
- `config.Get` type mismatches beyond int↔float fall back to the
  default silently (same as Python); a warnings channel like `Load`'s
  is deferred until a caller needs it.
- `Result.Warnings` (record-write failures, unparseable result-shaped
  lines) reach the operator via the CLI's stderr print only — there is
  no durable warnings sink. Deliberate, not deferred laziness: the
  warning's usual cause is a failing store write, and any durable sink
  would live in that same workspace, so "durably record that the store
  is failing, in the store" cannot be honest. A headless supervisor
  should capture stderr; the code comments now claim exactly this much
  and no more (adversarial r3 2026-08-22, Skeptic).
- `jsonx` with NO fence present still takes the first balanced bracket
  in prose — shared verbatim with Python `_find_json_bounds`; fixing it
  is a cross-runtime change, not a Go patch.

## Running

```sh
cd go
go test ./...
go build ./cmd/maro

# Safe smoke against a scratch workspace:
MARO_WORKSPACE=/tmp/maro-go-smoke ./maro run "say hi" -backend dry

# Real run (claude CLI backend, writes to the resolved workspace —
# the first output line SAYS which). Tool-bearing executor steps are the
# DEFAULT on the subprocess backend: the worker's own tools do real work
# in <workspace>/projects/<goal-slug>/, per-step transcripts land in its
# artifacts/ dir. -safe forces the tool-less utility mode.
./maro run "summarize the difference between a breaker and a truncator" -max-steps 3
./maro run -safe "classify this goal, do not execute it" -max-steps 2
```

## Branch mechanics

Branch `go-port`, worktree `../maro-wt-goport`, pushed with plain
`git push origin go-port` — `scripts/land.sh` is main-only and this
branch does not land to main.
