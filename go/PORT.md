# Maro Go Port — exploration branch

Jeremy, 2026-08-21: *"Let's go nuts and pivot for a while. Let's make a
branch and port maro to golang."* (Clarified same session: a
long-considered exploration in its own right — *"Worst case we learn
nothing and waste some tokens."*) The Python runtime at the repo root
**remains production**; this directory is the experiment.

## Doctrine — port the lessons, not just the code

The Python codebase enforces its hard-won invariants with tripwires
(AST scanners, registries, pin tests) because Python can't stop the bug
class at the point of writing. The port's bet is that Go can make some
of them **structural**:

| Python lesson (how it's enforced there) | Go shape here |
|---|---|
| Caps are data-driven or they go; every override needs a written why (`test_budget_override_discipline.py` registry) | `budget.Budget{Name, Limit, Why}` — the rationale is a field; a package test fails on any empty `Why` |
| No silent truncation — cuts must be marked (`context_budget.clip` + slice census) | `budget.Clip` is the only shortening idiom; marker byte-identical to Python's so records interoperate |
| No swallowed errors (`except: pass` audits) | errors are returned or recorded; a failed step carries its real reason into the failure chain |
| The resolved store is part of the result (2026-08-16 live-ledger incident) | `record.New(workspaceDir)` takes the store as an argument; `cmd/maro` prints the resolved workspace before any write |
| Data retention: append-only, never auto-delete | `record` has no delete/rotate/compact verbs at all |
| Named agentic seams (`purpose=` on every call) | `llm.Options.Purpose` is on every call site |

## On-disk compatibility

Same workspace resolution as Python `config.workspace_root`, name for
name and in the same order (`MARO_WORKSPACE` > `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE` >
`WORKSPACE_ROOT` > `~/.maro/workspace`; `MARO_USER_DIR` moves only the
user-config tier, and **there is no MARO_HOME** — the 2026-08-16
live-ledger incident variable stays unread). Same record files, same
shapes:

- `memory/outcomes.jsonl` — compatible key subset;
  `measurement_class: "go-port"` fences Go rows in analyses. `cost_usd`
  is deliberately absent (no estimator ported; missing ≠ zero).
- `memory/captains_log.jsonl` — `{timestamp, event_type, subject,
  summary, audience, context, loop_id}`.
- Appends take the same advisory flock on the same sibling
  `<file>.lock` files as Python `file_lock.locked_append` (fail-closed,
  torn-tail framing), so both runtimes can write one workspace without
  corrupting each other's rows.

dev-recall, the viz server, and the learning pipeline read both
runtimes' history through one lens.

## What v0 is (and is not)

**Ported and running (spine-first vertical slice):**

- `internal/config` — two-tier YAML (user < workspace), one-level-deep
  nested merge, env path overrides; parse failures are *reported*, never
  swallowed.
- `internal/budget` — the caps discipline (see doctrine).
- `internal/llm` — adapter seam + `claude` CLI subprocess backend
  (flag-for-flag with the Python adapter, stream-json result parsing)
  and Anthropic Messages API backend; scripted `Fake` for tests/dry-run.
- `internal/jsonx` — tolerant JSON extraction (fences, prose,
  brackets-inside-strings), strict about content (non-string steps
  error, never coerce).
- `internal/planner` — decompose with operator docs
  (GOALS/CONTEXT/SIGNALS.md) riding whole under the OperatorDoc budget.
- `internal/loop` — decompose → execute → record, prior-step evidence
  budgeted+marked, blocked reasons traveling whole.
- `cmd/maro` — `maro run "goal" [-max-steps N] [-backend ...] [-model X]`.

**Pack tranche (2026-08-22, "export then import success"):**

- `internal/pack` — the full maro-pack lifecycle: `export` (gather +
  scrub + REVIEW.md), `seal` (review-hash + payload-digest stamps),
  `import` (trust demotion per PORTABLE_LEARNING_DESIGN §3), `adopt`
  (quarantine → live with provenance frontmatter). CLI:
  `maro pack export|seal|import|adopt`.
- `internal/scrub` — secret_scrub.py port (secret shapes + known-local
  identifiers; the human review gate remains the real backstop).
- `internal/provenance` — the Tier-0 lesson-provenance classifier,
  re-applied at import so transport cannot launder a prompt-derived
  lesson into an injectable one (db37d525 class).
- `internal/knowledge` — the MINIMAL Python-schema store surface the
  importer lands in: hypotheses + medium-tier lessons, full asdict()
  field parity, plus the variant-union rewrite (identity collision
  skips the row, not its rationale).

**Cross-runtime proof** (`crossrt_smoke.sh`, run live 2026-08-22): the
full circle Python export → Go import → Go export → Python import
passes — each seal verified by the RECEIVING runtime's independent
recomputation of the canonical payload digest
(`json.dumps(sort_keys, separators=(",",":"), ensure_ascii=False)`
reproduced byte-for-byte in `canonical.go`, pinned against
CPython-generated fixtures), trust demoted at every hop
(contested-by-birth compounds: `imported-xrt-go-imported-xrt-py-…`),
and Python's own loaders (`load_hypotheses`, `load_tiered_lessons`)
parse every Go-written row. The two runtimes also share the flock
protocol on `memory/.pack-import.lock`, so concurrent imports from
either runtime into one workspace serialize.

**Pack-tranche residuals, named:**

- `skill_records` quarantine to `imports/<label>/` instead of importing
  natively (outcome string `quarantined_no_native_skill_store_v1`) —
  this runtime has no skills store until the tools tranche; the rows
  are preserved verbatim, nothing is half-imported.
- `--include-runs` (Class E opt-in) and `--include-playbook`'s Python
  interactive-confirm shim are not ported; playbook export works via
  the flag, runs export does not exist yet.
- Rules/hypotheses lanes share Python's intra-artifact behavior of
  deduping by id but not adding each imported TEXT to the identity
  snapshot mid-artifact (lessons do; the asymmetry is upstream's —
  kept bug-for-bug so transport semantics stay identical, worth fixing
  in BOTH runtimes together).
- The import-side classifier gets (lesson, source_goal) only, like
  Python's import call site — the evidence leg is a mint-time-only
  signal in both runtimes.

**Pack adversarial round (2026-08-22, 4 lenses, sonnet-medium fallback)
— fixed here, plus divergences deliberately kept and named:**

Go is now STRICTER than Python on several hostile shapes (all
refusal-direction, so no legitimate Python-produced pack is affected;
each is a candidate to backport to `src/pack.py`): decompression bounds
on untrusted archives (64MB/member, 256MB total, 4096 members — Python's
tarfile path is still unbounded); refusal of invalid-UTF-8 members and
lone-surrogate `\u` escapes in pack.json (Python crashes loudly on the
same input, Go's decoders would have silently substituted U+FFFD);
manifest/archive bijection at both seal and import (duplicate manifest
paths, un-manifested stowaway members, and manifest rows with no archive
member are all refused — Python KeyErrors on the missing-member case but
silently carries stowaways and double-imports duplicate paths); rows
whose id field is absent, null, empty, or composite (array/object) are
reported `malformed_skipped` — scalar ids (number/bool) are coerced to
Python's `str()` form and import at parity (r2 correction: Python's
f-string imports `{"rule_id": 42}` fine; only ABSENT/empty ids collapse
onto one shared `imported-<pack>-` identity there, silently eaten as
`already_imported`, and Python stringifies null/composites into junk
ids); `pack_format`
that is present but not a valid integer is a hard refusal (Python
TypeErrors — closed, but as a crash).

Behavior ported to parity in the same round: the
`knowledge.provenance_gate_enabled` killswitch (ambient config, string
"false"/"0"/"no"/"off" normalized; the incoming-stamp quarantine path
stays outside the gate, as in Python), the adopt audit row + full report
shape (`label`/`adopted_at`/`dry_run`), and `AbsorbVariant` re-ported
line-for-line (strip both sides, unicode-aware trim, pre- AND post-clip
identity checks).

Named textual divergences accepted (degenerate input only, no safety
effect): `asString` renders a JSON array as `[a b]` where Python's
`str()` gives `"['a', 'b']"`; RE2's `\b` is ASCII-only where Python's is
unicode-aware, so a non-ASCII username/hostname in the scrub denylist
could bound differently across runtimes (identifiers on this box are
ASCII; the human review gate is the backstop). Canonical-digest numbers:
Go preserves `json.Number` literals verbatim while Python re-normalizes
through `json.loads`/`dumps` — identical for every machine-written
manifest, divergent (→ digest mismatch → refusal) for hand-crafted
non-canonical literals; pinned by test, documented in `canonical.go`.
CLI drift: Go uses flags (`-pack`, `-name`) where Python's `maro-pack`
uses positionals, and Go has no `export --seal` one-shot and no
interactive confirm (missing `-yes` refuses rather than prompts).

Round 3 (fix-layer review, 2 lenses) additions: a decompressor-level
byte ceiling now sits BETWEEN gzip and tar, so PAX/GNU meta records the
stdlib consumes inside `tr.Next()` (1MiB each, unbounded in count,
invisible to the entry cap) are bounded categorically; JSONL rows decode
with UseNumber so numeric ids keep their source literal exactly (a
float64 round-trip diverged >2^53 ids from Python's arbitrary-precision
str() and let crafted neighbors collide); report rows come out in file
order (the r2 callback emitted malformed rows first); a malformed id's
report value is always a string. Note on null/composite ids: Python's
f-string stringifies those into junk ids and imports them — Go's
refusal is a deliberate over-refusal (safe direction), not parity.

Round 2 (fix-layer review, 2 lenses) additions: non-regular tar entries
(dirs/symlinks/devices) and duplicate member names are refused outright
and EVERY header counts against the entry cap (the r1 bounds skipped
non-regular headers before any cap — a decompress-loop bypass);
lone-surrogate escapes are refused per-row in JSONL content, not just
pack.json; Import refuses `pack.json`/`REVIEW.md` listed as artifacts
(matching Seal); explicit `provenance_gate_enabled: null` keeps the
gate ON in Go where Python's `bool(None)` turns it OFF (pinned, safe
direction).

**Executor tranche (2026-08-22, tool-bearing worker steps):**

`maro run` now defaults to the EXECUTOR lane on the subprocess backend
(`-safe` opts back into utility mode; the dry backend never requests it):

- Two subprocess lanes, matching Python's `no_tools` split: utility keeps
  `--tools ""` + a `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_OUTPUT_TOKENS=16000` runaway brake;
  executor enables the CLI's own tools with `--disallowedTools
  WebFetch,WebSearch`, binds cwd to the run's project dir
  (`<workspace>/projects/<slug>/`), and caps per-tool-call Bash
  output via `BASH_MAX_OUTPUT_LENGTH` with Python
  `_bash_output_cap_env`'s full precedence — including the
  disable-means-UNSET-in-child semantics that Python's 2026-07-27 review
  paid for. The deny-list is a convenience, NOT an egress boundary: Bash
  stays enabled, so the worker can still fetch (curl, git). Python's
  actual boundary is the container lane (`executor.container`), which is
  unported — until then an exec run trusts the goal text the way any
  uncontained agent session does (adversarial exec review 2026-08-22,
  Skeptic; the old phrasing over-claimed).
- The simulated tool-call protocol (`_TOOL_INJECTION_TEMPLATE` verbatim,
  with the load-bearing "Never execute it" line): workers report via
  `complete_step` (result/summary/confidence/inject_steps) or
  `flag_stuck` (reason/attempted); no parseable tool call falls back to
  content-as-result (Python parity). Parsing is strict (whole-span,
  UseNumber, trailing data refused); `llm.ParseToolCall` is invoked at
  the loop's call site, not inside the adapter — a named divergence:
  Python parses adapter-side because its API backends have native
  tool_use; Go grows that when one is ported.
- Plan mutation: `inject_steps` splices at the FRONT of the queue
  (Python `remaining_steps[:0]`), capped 3/step, each clipped by a
  registered budget (`injected-step`, 500); total executed steps are
  capped at 2× the planned count — an honest stand-in for Python's
  `max_iterations` machinery (adaptive bumping not ported); exhaustion
  marks the run stuck with the remainder NAMED (step contents, not a
  count) in the failure chain. Worker-injected steps carry a
  `WasInjected` tag all the way to the CLI's step printout — plan
  mutation is visible in the delivered output, not only in records.
- Project-dir resolution is the full `resolve_project_slug` port:
  naive 5-word slugs collide on generic openers ("tell me about
  the…"), so an existing dir with a generic slug and a DIFFERENT
  recorded mission disambiguates via `-2`…`-20` suffixes, then a goal-
  hash fallback (returned unchecked — Python parity); same mission
  re-enters its dir (continuity), specific slugs reuse without
  ceremony, and a reuse decided on WEAK evidence (no recorded mission,
  phrasing-only tails) is warned, never silent. Named divergence:
  Python reads the recorded mission from NEXT.md's goal line; Go
  records a `.mission` file at project creation — written
  full-content-then-`link(2)` so first-writer-wins holds atomically
  WITH its content (a crash mid-write must not leave an empty file
  that reads as "no evidence" forever) — and FALLS BACK to parsing a
  Python-written NEXT.md `> goal` line, because the runtimes share one
  workspace format and the guard must not be blind on the interop side
  (adversarial exec r2, Skeptic). Without all this, two unrelated runs
  silently share a live project dir and the second worker acts on the
  first's files — all four r1 lenses flagged it.
- Disambiguation only settles SEQUENTIAL collisions; the CONCURRENT
  case is closed by the ported admission gate (`loop/slot.go`, Python
  `acquire_project_slot`): a per-project flock at
  `<workspace>/memory/loop-<slug>.lock`, claimed before the first
  project write, held for the run, refuse-immediately on busy (the
  refusal records a stuck outcome naming the holder), and fs errors
  degrade to UNGATED with a warning. A busy-refused run NEVER removes
  the project dir — the slot holder may be a racing winner that just
  created it and hasn't written .mission yet (Python never deletes on
  LoopBusy; the r3 review caught the r2 cleanup rmdir'ing the winner's
  still-empty dir). Live-fired (two concurrent same-goal real-CLI runs
  → one completed, one refused with holder metadata) AND pinned by an
  automated race-detector-clean concurrent-Run test.
  Unported, named in slot.go: `--wait` polling, in-process sibling
  slot sharing, the unlink/reacquire inode guard, busy_policy=worktree.
- The blocked-step LADDER (`loop/blocked.go`, Python `loop_blocked`'s
  Phase 62 zoom-metacognition algorithm) replaces the flat first-block
  halt: NEED_INFO spawns research-then-retry; a missing external input
  is an honest terminal (never retried, split, or FABRICATED — the
  fabricated-input false-success bug); combined exec+analyze steps get
  the structural split; timeouts get an LLM split (45s, heuristic
  sentence-boundary fallback) or an honest terminal; then
  convergence-aware retry (md5-fingerprint parity with Python, pinned
  against CPython fixtures; round-1 generic hint, round-2 LLM
  refinement hint threaded into the retry prompt with the RETRY
  REMINDER), sibling-failure-rate re-decomposition (>50% blocked with
  ≥3 executed, current attempt EXCLUDED from the evidence — Python
  decides before appending to step_outcomes; the ladder r1 review
  caught Go self-counting the just-blocked attempt, which fired
  premature redecompose on small plans), re-decompose via the planner
  (≤5 sub-steps, capped at
  2 replans), and a terminal verdict that halts with the reason, the
  stop verdict, and the unexecuted remainder NAMED. Since r2 the
  verdict and the whole stuck reason land in TYPED outcome columns
  (stop_verdict / stuck_reason — Python memory.record_outcome and the
  loop result dict), and the chain entry's verdict tag is appended
  AFTER the entry's single clip (marker-class): the chain text was the
  only carrier, and the 600-char entry clip could eat the tag and the
  do-not-fabricate instruction on exactly the long-reason runs that
  need them (r2, both lenses independently — this round's HIGH again
  sat in the previous round's fix). Thresholds verbatim (3 retries /
  0.5 sibling / 2 replans / 3-consecutive-ceiling-timeout adapter-hung
  bail). Every decision is recorded as a METACOGNITIVE_DECISION event
  with the evidence (retries, fingerprints, replan count, action). A
  recovered run is DONE with its blocked attempts still in the record.
  The tool-less lane keeps v0's run-through — deliberate asymmetry.
  Ladder r1 fix layer (adversarial, 4 lenses, sonnet-medium fallback):
  the INITIAL plan is shaped too (Python's label="initial-plan" pass —
  a combined exec+analyze step no longer burns a worker call before
  the reactive split sees it; r2 made it UNCONDITIONAL across both
  lanes like Python's _prepare_execution, and closed the fourth
  shaping surface — worker inject_steps, Python's label="inject");
  blocked outcomes carry a typed
  (StuckReason, Attempted) pair mirroring Python's separate
  stuck_reason/result fields, so the fingerprint gets independent
  200-char heads and the missing-input check reads BOTH signal sources
  (honest scope, named r2: the second signal is live for flag_stuck
  only — llm.ResultError has no partial-output carrier, so Python's
  killed-subprocess tail (step_exec.py:1659, last 2000 chars) is
  structurally unavailable until the adapter grows one);
  the MISSING_INPUT inner clip is Python's clip(reason, 1000) runaway
  bound, not the 600-char chain budget (which guaranteed the
  do-not-fabricate instruction fell off the assembled entry); the
  timeout-split and refinement-hint calls return their token usage into
  the run totals (with the failed-call ResultError salvage); a
  successful step resets the consecutive-timeout streak (Python
  loop_execute.py:1884 — without it, non-consecutive timeouts
  accumulated to a false adapter-hung bail); split/redecompose children
  of a worker-injected step keep the WasInjected audit mark. All six
  fixes carry mutation-verified must-detect pins.
  Unported ladder pieces, named: token_runaway abandonment (no ingest
  brake), escape-pattern demotion hints (step_exec detectors), mid-loop
  diagnosis consult (introspect, Phase 44), navigator shadow, per-role
  model routing for split/hint calls, retry model-tier escalation
  (loop_blocked.py:235-242 cheap→mid→power via step_tier_overrides —
  Go has no model-tier registry; retries re-run on the same adapter),
  the pending_context injection
  seam (hints ride the step prompt), boundary/recon tag guards in step
  shaping, mid-loop iteration-budget bump (the 2× cap stays the outer
  breaker — binding on small plans: for a 1-step plan the cap is 2, so
  the 3-retry threshold is structurally unreachable there; Python's
  max_iterations=40 + one-time 50% bump machinery is what actually
  gives the ladder room). Known shared-key risk, inherited from Python:
  stepRetries/stepFingerprints key by literal step text, so two plan
  positions with byte-identical text (e.g. two splits both falling back
  to the generic analysis clause) share retry/fingerprint state.
- Closure verification (`internal/closure` + `internal/runs`) — done ≠
  successful, made structural. The loop's "done" says the steps
  drained; only `closure.Verify` says the GOAL was achieved, and the
  two stamps stay separate. The pipeline is Python
  closure_verify.verify_goal_completion's spine: plan checks by
  INVERSION (LLM, plan prompt ported with the stated-guarantee and
  deliverable sections trimmed to what this runtime supplies) → run
  them MECHANICALLY (bash -c — a NAMED upgrade, not parity: Python's
  shell=True resolves to /bin/sh (dash on this box), while the shared
  plan prompt's own scaffolding examples use bash idioms, so Go runs
  the shell the prompt teaches; per-check timeout with a PROCESS-GROUP
  kill — Setpgid + kill(-pgid), closing the orphaned-background-server
  leak Python shares — plus a WaitDelay backstop (2s, scaled to
  timeout/4 for short budgets): a probe that DETACHES (setsid/double-
  fork) escapes the group AND holds the output pipes, and without
  WaitDelay Wait() blocks for the escapee's whole lifetime (r2); the
  ErrWaitDelay return REAPS the group itself — the ctx-watchdog kill
  stands down once Wait returns, so the early return would otherwise
  leak the merely-backgrounded child the pre-r2 code reaped at the
  deadline (r3; a setsid escapee still outlives both, as it always
  did); probe output is buffered unbounded in memory before
  truncation — Python capture_output parity, named not silent; per-check stdout/stderr stored at 500/300 RUNE
  cuts, with outcome classified on the FULL stderr first — the
  inconclusive phrases sit at the end of verbose diagnostics; cwd =
  the exec lane's project dir; cwd unresolved → checks
  REFUSED as env-unresolved inconclusive rows, never run in the
  launcher's directory — B3a) → verdict (LLM) → verdict integrity.
  Ported lessons, each with a pinned test: pass/fail/INCONCLUSIVE
  tri-state per probe (_check_outcome branch-for-branch — the
  verifier's own failure is missing data, not disproof); judged
  tri-state (all-inconclusive → judged=false → goal_achieved stamp
  ABSENT, the 4/5-false-negatived-dogfood lesson); the
  ungrounded-False confidence cap (complete=false contradicting every
  executed probe with no file content in evidence → 0.65, below the
  trust floor, cut marked in the summary — run 2738d9c0); the
  behavioral-gap downgrade Signal 1 (the verdict's own prose admits
  runtime wasn't exercised + zero behavioral-modality probes →
  deterministic flip with the reason as the summary opener — and it is
  UNCONDITIONALLY live here: Python's 18773dfa stand-down gate keys on
  resolved_intent deliverables, which are unported, so Go behaves like
  Python with resolved_intent=None — parity-with-None, but the
  false-demotion risk for honestly-worded all-document goals returns
  with the intent subsystem and is owed the gate then);
  verdict-first summaries (the FLAG writes the opener; prose can only
  elaborate — run d2f4e2f4); per-segment probe-modality
  classification (quote-aware top-level split, most-behavioral wins,
  hint-before-runner precedence, non-exec runner flags — CPython
  fixture parity); closure_fingerprint byte-parity (md5 12-hex over
  sorted normalized hard-fail signatures, §9.3 — cross-runtime verdict
  rows compare); work summary with VISIBLE truncation (4000/300/6
  Python-parity literals, cut and COUNTED in runes — Python len()
  semantics; the markers are judge-facing parity text, deliberately
  not budget.Clip's vocabulary); the
  project-file-inventory grounding block (probe paths that EXIST —
  2026-07-09: two known-good runs false-negatived by checks against
  invented filenames); every closure outcome — verdict or NAMED skip —
  a durable row in build/closure_verdicts.jsonl
  (persist-the-artifacts decree). `internal/runs` is the WRITER half
  of the metadata contract recall.FindPriorAttempts reads (the gap
  named since the recall tranche): run dir + source/build/artifact
  skeleton, prompt.txt first-wins, metadata.json merge-writes
  (started_at first-writer-wins, nil POPS a key, atomic temp+rename),
  StampVerdict = _apply_verdict_tuple parity (every member set or
  popped, gaps capped at 5 with an announced count cut). Wiring:
  run dir created BEFORE recall and the run excluded from its own
  prior-attempt scan (recall.RecallExcluding); closure fires on ANY
  exec-lane run that executed a step — Python's
  _closure_eligible_statuses semantics: a stuck run that wrote real
  files still gets the honest what-got-delivered signal — with named
  skip rows ("no_steps_ran", "tool_less_lane",
  "outcome_record_failed") for every terminal path that doesn't judge
  (CLOSURE_VERDICT event after LOOP_FINISHED); Verify wrapped in a
  deferred recover persisting an "exception" row (the 2026-07-27
  both-tire-runs lesson — an uncaught panic here would crash the loop
  AFTER the work succeeded); the durable row carries the Python-parity
  check_results array (per-check description/command/exit/outcome/
  stdout/stderr) and is SCRUBBED at the single write owner
  (runs.AppendVerdictRow, via a UseNumber JSON round-trip because
  scrub.Walk descends only decoded shapes and a plain decode would
  widen int64s through float64); judge PROSE (summary/gaps) is scrubbed
  once more at Verify's return boundary because it flows to four
  consumers — row, metadata stamp, event, CLI (r2: the CLI line was a
  second unscrubbed egress). Residual, Python-parity, named: stored
  stdout/stderr are truncated BEFORE the row scrub, so a secret
  straddling the 500/300 cut can leave an unmatchable fragment;
  FailedChecks stay raw on purpose (the fingerprint must be computable
  identically anywhere in the run's lifetime — Python fingerprints
  unscrubbed signatures too). closure.Options.DryRun is exercised only
  by direct unit callers — the composed loop path gates on !DryRun
  before Verify, so the field is honest for library callers, inert on
  the CLI path (r2, named not logged-as-wired); the verdict line reaches the CLI
  beside the DONE/STUCK banner — done ≠ successful is operator-visible,
  not write-only;
  goal_achieved tri-state stamps only judged verdicts and feeds the
  NEXT run's recall icons — pure-Go workspaces stop degrading to zero
  prior attempts. Named divergences: the tool-less lane SKIPS closure
  with a durable "tool_less_lane" row (it structurally writes no
  files; Python judges all lanes because every lane there has a cwd);
  a verdict missing its "complete" flag is REFUSED as
  verdict_parse_failed (Python defaults the missing key to true —
  Go-stricter, a verdict without its load-bearing flag is not a
  verdict); dry-run/nil-adapter skips leave no row (Python parity).
  Deliberately unported with their subsystems: scope failure modes,
  resolved-intent deliverables + precondition preflight,
  stated-guarantee claim coverage, the verdict AUDIT (second-opinion
  pass over negatives), NEXT.md ledger gap, failed-check file
  evidence (so the ungrounded-False cap covers every all-passed
  confident False here), behavioral-gap Signals 2/3, nicknames /
  run-ref index / thread brains / locked_rmw (the Go loop is
  metadata.json's only writer — single-writer assumption NAMED, writes
  atomic so readers never tear), and the restart/declare-blocked
  DECISION consumers: evaluate_closure's action mapping waits for the
  restart machinery — the fingerprint is minted and persisted now so
  §9.3 convergence data accrues, but no Go caller yet disposes. Also
  unported: the DONE_WITHOUT_VERDICT tripwire (runs.close_run's
  finished-without-closure detector, LT-0 b) — it belongs to the
  stranded-run-sweep family; until it ports, a crash between
  StampVerdict and Finalize leaves a "running" record only recall's
  InterruptStatuses softens.
- Intent routing + the NOW lane (`internal/intent` + `internal/now`,
  director tranche slice 1) — the CLI stops assuming every goal is a
  loop. `intent.Classify` ports intent.py's routing half: LLM
  classification (prompt near-verbatim, 128 tokens, purpose "routing")
  with the heuristic keyword fallback (CPython fixture parity on lanes
  AND confidences), then the CAPABILITY overrides that win over
  classification — file-deliverable goals cannot run in a lane that
  writes no files (burn-in batch 3), live-data asks cannot run in a
  lane that fetches nothing (config-gated: now_lane.live_data_routing,
  flag OFF inert per the DEFAULTS.md contract). Boolean fields parse
  fail-OPEN (is-true-or-"true"); lane whitelisted, confidence
  safe_float'd. `now.Run` is handle.py's _run_now + _verify_now_outcome:
  one tool-less call (2048/0.4) then the now-verify judge (160 tokens —
  64 fit `{"fulfilled": false}` and no why, which shipped an inert fix
  once; run 2113a608) with the TRI-STATE verdict: fulfilled → stamped
  true; not fulfilled (including NON-ANSWERS — generic how-to-find-it
  guidance demotes) → incomplete + the judge's why; errored judge →
  fail-open UNJUDGED with the error MARKED (now_verify_error — a broken
  verdict pipe must not look like a deliberately unjudged run, review
  F7). NOW runs get run dirs, outcome rows (task_type "now",
  goal_achieved tri-state on the row like Python), StampVerdict
  (go_now_verify_v1), finalize. The routing decision is PRINTED
  (`lane: NOW (0.98) — …`) beside the exec-mode line; `-lane
  auto|now|agenda` forces. Live-fire: real classify routed NOW @0.98,
  real judge stamped goal_achieved=true on row + metadata. Named
  divergences (Go-stricter, deliberate): the link-triage NOW shortcut
  and the live-data URL exemption are BOTH unported — they assume the
  NOW lane pre-fetches carried URLs (web_fetch enrichment,
  conversational-compute decree), and Go's NOW lane fetches nothing, so
  honoring them would route unanswerable asks to a lane that cannot
  answer; the classifier prompt's link-read EXCEPTION paragraph is
  omitted for the same reason. Adversarial r1 hardening (2026-08-22):
  the judge's why is scrubbed AT THE BOUNDARY where it is set (closure
  doctrine — per-sink scrubbing missed the terminal, the one surface an
  operator reads); the trailing-rationale recovery is ported
  (verdictRationale — `{"fulfilled": false}` + prose after the JSON was
  the ed7cf400 shape; 160 tokens was only HALF that fix); the judge
  window is capped at 2000 chars with the VISIBLE truncation marker
  (_now_verify_payload parity — an unmarked window makes a judge report
  what it cannot see as not delivered); runs.StampVerdict confidence is
  now *float64 and nil POPS the key (Python confidence=None — the old
  signature fabricated `goal_verdict_confidence: 0` on every judged
  NOW verdict, "verified with zero confidence"); the outcome ROW
  carries goal_verdict_source (judged → go_now_verify_v1, errored
  judge → go_now_verify_error with goal_achieved absent, unparseable →
  no source) so F7's broken-pipe/unjudged distinction survives an
  unwatched run — go_-prefixed names, DIVERGING from Python's
  now_self_verdict* taxonomy on purpose (the Go judge is a different
  instrument; the fence is the point); refused-but-billed calls
  salvage llm.ResultError usage at all three new call sites (classify,
  answer, judge); and the routing classify call's spend is SEEDED into
  whichever lane runs (now.Run seedIn/seedOut, loop.Opts
  SeedTokens*) so outcome rows report the goal's full real cost.
  Adversarial r2 hardening (same day): the judge window's cut is
  RUNE-based (byte cuts split UTF-8 mid-rune and the marker miscounts —
  the closure tranche's cutRunes class); verdictRationale's brace scan
  is STRING-AWARE with an unbalanced-object guard (Go-stricter than
  Python's naive count: a brace inside a JSON string no longer closes
  the object early, and a truncated object recovers nothing instead of
  the raw JSON blob) and no longer clips internally (scrub-before-clip
  — a clip-first order could cut a credential mid-string past the
  fixed-length secret patterns); record.StampOutcomeVerdict ports
  memory_ledger.stamp_outcome_verdict — the loop lane's outcome row is
  written at finalization BEFORE closure judges, so the verdict lands
  on the row post-hoc under the same flock every appender takes
  (without it every closure-judged loop run read as permanently
  unjudged on the cross-runtime ledger); the closure stamp's
  confidence is gated WITH the verdict (unjudged closure stamps no
  confidence — Go-stricter than Python, which writes 0.0); verdict
  sources are shared record.Source* constants; and the CLI's routing
  block is extracted (routeLane) so classify-usage extraction is
  pinned with a real nonzero value.
  Adversarial r3 (same day): StampOutcomeVerdict gained the two
  Python behaviors the first port dropped — goal_verdict_at on every
  stamp (the framing→verdict delay the learning pipeline divides by)
  and verdict_history on judged-over-judged re-stamps (2026-08-10
  re-stamp-honesty decree: corrections preserve the superseded verdict
  on the row); nil confidence now LEAVES an existing row value
  untouched (Python merge semantics — deliberately different from
  runs.StampVerdict's full-replacement stamp where nil pops, both
  matching their Python owners); a failed row stamp writes a durable
  "outcome_row_stamp_failed" run-dir row beside the terminal warning
  (a silent failure recreates the headline bug behind a rarer
  trigger); verdictRationale strips <think> traces before recovery
  (jsonx.StripThink — Go-stricter, the Python sibling shares the gap);
  the ledger rewrite removes its temp file on a failed rename.
  Named residuals: the answer summary on the row is clipped but
  unscrubbed (Python parity — same residual as the loop's row, named
  there too); a crash between WriteOutcome and Finalize leaves a
  terminal row beside a "running" metadata.json (same window the loop
  has; recall's InterruptStatuses softens it); prose-BEFORE-JSON in a
  judge reply returns the whole text from verdictRationale, JSON
  included (Python parity, named in the function doc); the row stamp
  does not retry transient I/O errors (Python's max_attempts DEFAULTS
  to 1 too — its retry knob is unported until a caller needs it); the
  memory-provenance advisory marker (_mark_memory_provenance) is
  unported with its stores — returns with the memory tranche.
  Adversarial r4 (same day, convergence round): the exported
  StampOutcomeVerdict doc was corrected to the merge semantics the
  code implements (a doc lying about nil-handling is how zero-
  confidence-class bugs return); verdict_history string fields default
  to "" for rows judged by another writer (Python .get(k,"") parity —
  no JSON nulls where Python writes empty strings); pins added for the
  failure-marker path (fault injection: a directory squatting on the
  ledger's .tmp path), goal_verdict_at advancing on UNJUDGED re-stamps,
  and foreign-judged-row history. One operational note carried:
  nothing consumes closure_verdicts.jsonl operationally yet — the
  durable marker's discoverability is manual until a reader lands.
  Adversarial r5 (same day, near-fixpoint round — 0 HIGHs): the
  failure-marker's OWN write failure was discarded (`_ =`) — the
  doubly-failed case now appends a named warning ("outcome-row stamp
  marker write also failed"), covered at the AppendVerdictRow seam
  (M35 DETECTED) because loop-level double injection is
  non-deterministic by construction (the run's own verdict row creates
  the file before the marker fires — comment on the pin names this);
  the verdict_history key-presence gate got the explicit
  `prior != nil` normalization plus a comment naming the
  presence≈is-not-None invariant it leans on. Adversarial r6 (same
  day) confirmed FIXPOINT: 0 HIGHs; the null-gate got its explicit
  JSON-null pin (M36) and a dead Python citation was corrected to
  _verdict_row — test/doc only, tranche closed at six rounds.
  Deliberately unported with their
  subsystems: web_fetch enrichment, the deterministic provenance guard
  (claimed inputs/outputs on disk), check_goal_clarity + imperative
  rewrite (needs the ask-the-user surface), introspects_self's consumer
  (container-isolation routing — the field is carried, its consumer
  named), NOW artifact write, navigator dispatch, deferred learning,
  personas/workers (workers shipped in the director slice below), and
  director.py's plan/delegate/review layer (shipped as the director
  slice below).
- DIRECTOR plan/delegate/review (`internal/director` +
  `internal/workers`, `maro director "directive"`) — the routing
  tranche's second half: SPEC + tickets from one Director call
  (large-scope directives get the staged 4-6-ticket prompt, gated on
  the ported estimate_goal_scope zero-LLM heuristics), a non-fatal
  pre-plan challenger, per-ticket dispatch to persona-framed workers
  speaking the simulated tool protocol (deliver_result/flag_blocked),
  Director review of every output with reject-on-parse-failure (auto-
  accepting hides bad output), up to MAX_REVIEW_ROUNDS=2 revision
  rounds proceeding best-effort on exhaustion, and one compiled report.
  Ported lessons: bounded completed-context accumulator
  (budget.Accumulator — worker results re-sent to later workers grow
  quadratically in ticket count; eviction is ANNOUNCED, oldest-first,
  newest kept whole even over budget); report-echo tri-state on the
  LLM-compile path only (MH #6 — false means the worker's content was
  DROPPED on the way to the parent; the verbatim-concat fallbacks stay
  nil because a check that cannot fail proves nothing);
  WORKER_REPORT_OMISSION + WORKER_DELEGATION_GAP candidate events into
  captains_log.jsonl, the gap event scoped to worker-AUTHORED reasons
  only (adapter failures pattern-match the provision keywords and
  would contaminate the corpus — negative-control pinned); blocked-
  origin taxonomy (worker/adapter/empty); ResultError usage salvage
  (4th site); judge-window Clip(4000) before the review verdict;
  spec-parse fallback = one inferred ticket for the whole directive;
  director log JSON scrubbed at its single write boundary, atomic
  temp+rename, report_echoed kept nullable (nil ≠ false); the
  flags-after-goal refusal from `maro run`; RequiresExplicitAcceptance
  PRINTED as a warning (the approval surface is unported — a silent
  "inferred" on a deploy-shaped directive would fake consent).
  Adversarial r1 (same day, 4 lenses): 4 verified HIGHs fixed —
  gap-event prose now scrubbed before captains_log (Python's log_event
  doesn't scrub; backport candidate), review verdicts with
  missing/null/mistyped "accepted" now REJECT (Go-stricter than
  Python's absent-key accept, named), rejected-no-revision runs warn
  and the director log now persists review_decisions
  (ticket-correlated) + warnings (Python persists neither; backport
  candidate); plus malformed spec-ticket entries skip with a warning,
  the report-echo check judges the SAME clipped window the compiler
  saw (Python compares unclipped — named honesty divergence), the
  bare-content bar counts runes, challenger failures are named, and
  the judge windows ride the registered WorkerJudgeWindow budget.
  Deliberately unported, named: worker_slice memory injection +
  slice_echo (sqlite store), PersonaRegistry + persona files (inline
  personas only — Python's own fallback tier), lat.md graph injection,
  the skip-if-simple direct route (the Go CLI's intent lane owns that
  decision), container-exec backend contract, check-in/escalation +
  evaluate_closure (return with restart machinery), the MODEL_CHEAP
  challenger adapter (challenger runs on the run's adapter). CLI dry
  smoke green; mutations M37-M42 all DETECTED (review-safety flip,
  gap-event descoping, echo-asymmetry removal, silent eviction,
  unscrubbed log, dropped salvage). Adversarial r2 (2026-08-22,
  skeptic+qa): the r1 TicketID fix itself was the round's HIGH —
  revised tickets are now persisted with revision_of so every decision
  key resolves in the log; the accepted-field gate keeps the model's
  own reason/revision_request (a malformed-but-informative verdict
  still drives a revision round); malformed-entry warnings are bounded
  to one summary; whitespace-only guidance trims to empty; the CLI
  scrubs StuckReason/Reason and prints TicketID; scrub-at-set-point
  ACCEPTED-NAMED (sink-side is the boundary — set-point scrubbing
  would alter prompt inputs; sink census: writeLog + captains_log +
  CLI, all scrubbed). Mutations M49-M55 all DETECTED (M53's echo
  marker-vocab pin added only after its first run came back NOT
  DETECTED). Adversarial r3 (same day, skeptic+qa): the r2 fixes were
  again the HIGHs' home — the mid-loop guard fired on the sole
  iteration (double warning; "unreachable" comment false) and now
  warns only when rounds actually remain; the malformed counter
  covers non-object entries and a non-list tickets field warns with
  its type; CLI warnings scrubbed (sink census now actually closed);
  echo judge strips the whole clip marker (both budget wordings,
  offsets included) before term extraction instead of deleting two
  words after. Mutations M56-M60 all DETECTED.
- Memory RECALL (`internal/recall` + the retrieval half of
  `internal/knowledge`) — the loop reads what the system already knows
  before it plans. `recall.Recall` is the seam (recall.py's contract):
  read-only — STRICTER than Python here: even the times_applied
  receipt write-back is unported, so the Go seam writes nothing —
  and every failure degrades to "knows nothing", with degradations
  NAMED in the instrumentation sources (`error_*`,
  `lessons_skipped_rows`) instead of swallowed. Two substrates ported:
  - **Ranked tiered lessons**: `LoadTieredLessons` reads
    `memory/<tier>/lessons.jsonl` with Python's read-time decay
    derivation (effective = stored × 0.85^days since last_reinforced,
    MEDIUM only — LONG is promoted-permanent; stored scores never
    rewritten, which would compound decay), the per-row parse guard
    (one malformed/byte-torn/type-drifted row skips THAT row and
    counts it — never the tier; numeric fields coerced inside the
    guard exactly where Python's r3/r4 of the store-hardening arc put
    them), and min_score compared AFTER decay, skipped entirely on
    raw loads (Python's `not raw` ordering). `QueryLessonsScored`
    pools LONG+MEDIUM over the FULL store (limit=None — relevance is
    the ranker's job), drops provisional / quarantined
    (minted_from=="prompt", the db37d525 provenance gate) / contested
    rows, and ranks with the TF-IDF cosine ranker
    (`TFIDFRankScored`) — tokenizer, log-IDF, norm-or-1.0 cosine, and
    the 0.90 citation penalty pinned against CPython-computed fixtures
    to 1e-9, ties keeping input order (Python's stable sort). Parity
    quirk kept deliberately: a no-signal query returns ALL lessons in
    input order at 0.0, topK ignored — only the caller bounds it.
    Selection mirrors recall.py's chunk-6 rewire: agenda-typed top 3
    from a 10-wide scored window, untyped tiered top-up deduped by
    lesson_id. The render is the receipts block ("## Lessons from
    Prior Runs", ✓/✗ by outcome, "reinforced Nx / N sessions /
    applied Nx" or the honest "(observed once)") under the
    1200-char LessonInject budget as a whole-line BREAKER — never a
    mid-line truncation (caps decree 2026-08-21) — with
    cited-only-if-rendered (a dropped line's id never enters
    lesson_ids_cited; the contradiction join must not contest lessons
    the run never saw).
  - **Prior attempts**: `FindPriorAttempts` scans
    `runs/<dir>/metadata.json` newest-first (mtime, cap 200 —
    O(recent activity)), matching exact / near (word-overlap Jaccard
    ≥ 0.9, `_text_similarity` parity) / project, with SF-2 tri-state
    goal_achieved and the §13b status-derived external-interrupt
    fallback (interrupted/stranded/refused_busy/clarification_needed
    carry no goal evidence). The as_context_block summary paragraph
    (status breakdown, verdict counts, interrupted count,
    do-not-repeat instruction) rides under the RecallContext budget
    with Python's 64-char marker reserve.
  Both blocks reach the INITIAL `planner.Decompose` as system-prompt
  extras in Python's extras order (ancestry before lessons,
  planner.py:962) — the same two channels Python feeds decompose
  (lessons_context via loop_planning, the attempts summary via
  handle.py's as_context_block → ancestry_context). Redecompose/split
  calls deliberately get no recall block, like Python. The read is
  instrumented as a RECALL_PERFORMED captain's-log event before
  LOOP_STARTED; emission lives at the loop call site because the Go
  seam keeps no recorder handle (named divergence — Python emits from
  inside recall()); an event-write failure is held and lands in
  Result.Warnings or, when decompose also dies, the failure chain.
  Unported recall substrates, named (recall.py carries eight):
  standing rules, decision journal, graveyard resurrection (the one
  Python side effect — resurrect=True un-decays), failure notes,
  learning activity, playbook, knowledge nodes, thread identity
  (origin walk + ancestry.json), prior-decision briefs (run_card
  curation), project_artifacts inventory, dispatch_signals,
  portability re-weighting (§14a), camera frames, age stamps, the
  legacy flat-store top-up + fallback injector, magic-prefix stripping
  at the match boundary (a Python run recorded under a prefixed
  prompt can miss the near-match here), hybrid BM25/RRF ranking
  (`_USE_HYBRID`, optional rank-bm25 dep — TF-IDF is Python's own
  always-available fallback, so both runtimes share this floor), and
  max-age pruning at the query layer. The Go runtime also does not
  WRITE `runs/<dir>/metadata.json` yet, so prior attempts surface only
  in a workspace shared with Python — a pure-Go workspace honestly
  degrades to zero priors. Go-stricter divergences, refusal-direction:
  type-drifted STRING fields skip the row (Python's duck-typed
  dataclass carries them until they explode inside the ranker);
  byte-invalid rows are refused before decode (Go's encoding/json
  would otherwise launder invalid UTF-8 into U+FFFD — the corruption
  signal loads_clean exists to preserve); NON-FINITE numeric strings
  ("NaN"/"Infinity" — both strconv.ParseFloat and Python float()
  accept them) fail the row and are counted, because a NaN score
  survives every MinScore filter (`NaN < x` is always false) uncounted
  (r1 Skeptic); Python-truthiness is kept where it is load-bearing
  (`provisional: "false"` is truthy and stays filtered;
  a type-drifted truthy `evidence_sources` value stays CITED via a
  one-element carrier — the shape-only assertion silently applied the
  0.90 penalty Python would not, r1 Skeptic + Expert QA
  independently). Container fields with NO ranking consumer
  (imported/canon/delta_evidence/grounding/merged_variants) coerce to
  empty on shape drift without failing the row — behavior-inert
  today; a future consumer of those fields must revisit that choice.
  Recall r1 fix layer (adversarial, 4 lenses, sonnet-medium
  fallback): LoadOptions' zero value now means UNLIMITED — the
  Limit<0-for-unlimited draft made `LoadOptions{}` silently return an
  empty result set indistinguishable from an empty store (the round's
  HIGH; zero value must degrade to "everything", never "nothing");
  Recall carries a recover() folding an unanticipated panic into
  Sources["error_recall_panic"] (the Go stand-in for Python's
  per-substrate except blankets — this seam eats hand-editable data
  and must never crash a run); ContextBlock ports the 2026-08-14
  degenerate-budget floor WITH the subtraction (limit-64 ≤ 0 would
  hit Clip's breaker-off path and return unbounded text); the
  metadata-scan cap comment states honestly that it bounds only the
  read phase (the listing+stat phase is O(lifetime runs) in BOTH
  runtimes — inherited, needs a shared index to fix); prior-attempt
  ordering is a lexical sort on raw started_at, byte-for-byte
  Python's — known-preserved misordering across heterogeneous
  timestamp shapes. Further named after r1: the tiered-store
  QUARANTINE SIDECAR (_quarantine_unparseable) is unported —
  LoadTieredLessons is a pure READER and must not be reused as the
  read half of a rebuild-style rewrite (reinforce/promote/GC) until
  the sidecar lands, or skipped rows would be destroyed on rewrite
  (the exact Python incident the sidecar closed; the existing
  UnionVariantsIntoLesson is line-in-place and preserves undecodable
  rows, so it is not exposed); the lesson-render icon drops Python's
  SF-2 goal_achieved-preferred branch — dead code in Python today (no
  writer stamps goal_achieved on tiered rows) and TieredLesson has no
  such field here, so wiring it up in Python requires a synchronized
  Go patch; readers of lessons.jsonl take no flock in either runtime
  (writers do) — safe while every writer is a single write() or an
  atomic rename; LoadOptions' Raw/MaxAgeDays/LessonType surface and
  FindPriorAttempts' windowHours/excludeHandleID/project parameters
  are Python-parity surface with no production Go caller yet
  (unit-tested only; the project lane is dead on the CLI path until
  project threading lands pre-decompose).
  Recall r2 fix layer (adversarial, 2 lenses, sonnet-medium
  fallback): the r1 citedness fix had an unfixed WRITER sibling —
  pack import's shape-only `.([]any)` assertion PERSISTED drifted
  truthy evidence as `[]`, making the row permanently uncited (the
  read-side fix could never help a row the write side already
  flattened; both lenses found it independently, and it is the
  flagship pattern's 11th instance — the round's top finding sat
  inside the previous round's fix). One owner now:
  knowledge.CoerceEvidenceSources is the single truthiness-preserving
  coercion, called by the tiered reader AND the pack importer, with a
  round-trip pin (TestImportPreservesCitednessThroughTypeDrift).
  Also from r2: the recover now captures debug.Stack() under a new
  PanicTrace budget (a bare panic value with no trace is
  un-actionable; a panicHook test seam proves the recover fires and
  that pre-panic partial results survive); FindPriorAttempts returns
  a skipped count surfaced as Sources["prior_attempts_skipped"]
  (malformed run metadata was silently invisible — same
  short-read-vs-short-store honesty rule as the lesson loader);
  truthy(json.Number) parse-failure fails OPEN to truthy (the
  conservative direction for provisional/contested gates — pinned);
  the ContextBlock degenerate floor and the happy-path event-failure
  warning each gained the executing test their prose claimed.
  Named accepted (r2): with Limit<=0 as unlimited there is no way to
  request literally zero rows — acceptable because no caller wants an
  empty read from a retrieval API (comment on LoadOptions).
  Recall r3 fix layer (adversarial, 1 QA lens, sonnet-medium
  fallback): the r2 fix generalized the MECHANISM for the one named
  field but not the RULE across the function — one field below the
  citedness rewire, `provisional` was still a shape-only `.(bool)`
  read, so `"provisional": "true"` imported as TRUSTED and sailed
  past the recall-time provisional gate (trust escalation, strictly
  worse than the 0.90 penalty the r2 fix closed; flagship pattern
  instance #12). knowledge.Truthy is now EXPORTED as the boolean
  half of the boundary rule (CoerceEvidenceSources is the container
  half): every gate-feeding value crossing the pack-import boundary
  preserves Python truthiness, not JSON shape, with round-trip pins
  for both directions of drift. Also from r3: the panic VALUE is
  clipped separately (new PanicValue budget, 500) before joining the
  stack under PanicTrace, so a payload-carrying panic value cannot
  crowd the stack — the actionable half — out of the budget; the
  panicHook seam carries a no-t.Parallel() comment (unsynchronized
  by design, single production caller).
  Recall r4 (adversarial, 1 Skeptic lens, sonnet-medium fallback —
  the CONVERGENCE round: no HIGH, no production-code defect).
  Operational note (r4 MED): any pack imported by a pre-51377350 Go
  build persisted drifted provisional flags as a durable
  `"provisional": false` — indistinguishable on disk from a
  legitimately trusted row, and not repairable after the fact
  (the original string was overwritten). Re-import such packs with a
  current build. No deployment is affected today: the Go port is
  pre-production by decree and no pre-fix Go importer ran outside
  this branch's own tests. Accepted-named (r4): pack import's
  human_reviewed read stays a shape-only .(bool) — BOTH writers emit
  native booleans and the failure direction is the safe one (a
  forged string fails the assertion and the pack is REFUSED, not
  trusted; fail-closed is correct for a review gate, so routing it
  through Truthy would be a step backward); the panicHook
  no-t.Parallel() constraint stays comment-grade until the seam
  grows a second caller.
- A run whose project-dir setup fails still records a stuck outcome
  carrying the planning spend before erroring out; a transcript file
  that cannot be created degrades to the deleted-temp capture with a
  warning rather than failing the step — an OS error must not
  fabricate a "blocked" record blaming the model.
- Long-running step classification ported (keyword sets verbatim,
  `MARO_LONG_RUNNING_TIMEOUT`, full-suite ×2 capped at 3600s); executor
  default timeout 600s like Python's adapter default.
- Per-step transcripts: the merged stream-json capture persists to
  `<project>/artifacts/step-N-transcript.jsonl` (artifacts-over-streams;
  kept on success AND failure, never deleted by the adapter).
- Capability is structural: the named `llm.AgentToolsCapable` interface
  (one type, asserted by every reader); a requested exec run on an
  incapable backend degrades to the tool-less path WITH a warning
  (never silently), and the `-model` CLI wrapper forwards the
  capability (interface embedding would otherwise strip it). The CLI
  decides exec ONCE from the constructed adapter's capability and
  prints the entered mode plainly (`exec mode: ON/off — …`) — default-
  on tool-bearing execution is the run's highest-blast-radius property
  and must be visible without reading code.
- `EXECUTE_SYSTEM` ported as the sections whose machinery exists here
  (synchronous-execution, anti-hallucination, NEED_INFO, URL-fetch
  discipline, file-edit protocol, token efficiency). Deliberately
  dropped, because advertising a silently-dropped field is worse than
  omitting it: artifacts, decisions, world_facts channels,
  ask-may-be-wrong, also-noticed, pre-fetched-URL block,
  create_team_worker, step-type classification/prompt extras
  (data-pipeline, artifact-materialize, long-lived-process,
  recon-flavor). Each returns with its consumer.

Unported from Python's executor lane, named: container wrap
(`executor.container`), executor sessions + fork-master, token-runaway
brake, constraint tiers/HITL gates, URL pre-fetch, worker push guard
(`missing_write_targets`), tool-pathology classification, per-step model
routing/trajectory escalation.

**Deliberately NOT ported yet (next tranches, in rough order of value):**

1. ~~Memory recall + knowledge injection~~ — ranked-lesson +
   prior-attempt slice DONE (recall tranche above); playbook, edges,
   and the other named substrates return with their consumers.
2. ~~Closure verification~~ — evidence pipeline + verdict stamp DONE
   (closure tranche above); the quality-gate half (step-level review)
   and the restart consumers return with their subsystems.
3. ~~Intent routing + NOW-vs-AGENDA lanes~~ — DONE (routing tranche
   slice above); ~~director's plan/delegate/review~~ DONE (director
   slice above); the evaluate_closure decision layer + check-in/
   escalation machinery remain (they return with restart machinery).
4. Inspector/evolver self-improvement loop.
5. Heartbeat, projects, escalation, notifications, viz.

**Named smaller gaps, accepted for v0** (adversarial round 2026-08-22 —
4 lenses, sonnet-medium fallback; each of these was flagged and either
fixed or parked here honestly):

- Subprocess liveness/stall kill: only the wall-clock timeout exists;
  Python `_run_subprocess_safe`'s mtime/CPU-stall detection is not
  ported. Output capture is disk-backed, so memory stays bounded.
- `cost_usd` estimation: rows omit the field rather than lie `0.0`.
- `config.Get` type mismatches beyond int↔float fall back to the
  default silently (same as Python); a warnings channel like `Load`'s
  is deferred until a caller needs it.
- `Result.Warnings` (record-write failures, unparseable result-shaped
  lines) reach the operator via the CLI's stderr print only — there is
  no durable warnings sink. Deliberate, not deferred laziness: the
  warning's usual cause is a failing store write, and any durable sink
  would live in that same workspace, so "durably record that the store
  is failing, in the store" cannot be honest. A headless supervisor
  should capture stderr; the code comments now claim exactly this much
  and no more (adversarial r3 2026-08-22, Skeptic).
- `jsonx` with NO fence present still takes the first balanced bracket
  in prose — shared verbatim with Python `_find_json_bounds`; fixing it
  is a cross-runtime change, not a Go patch.

## Branch mechanics

Branch `go-port`, worktree `../maro-wt-goport`, pushed with plain
`git push origin go-port` — `scripts/land.sh` is main-only and this
branch does not land to main.
