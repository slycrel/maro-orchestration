# Maro Go Port — exploration branch

Jeremy, 2026-08-21: *"Let's go nuts and pivot for a while. Let's make a
branch and port maro to golang."* (Clarified same session: a
long-considered exploration in its own right — *"Worst case we learn
nothing and waste some tokens."*) The Python runtime at the repo root
**remains production**; this directory is the experiment.

## Doctrine — port the lessons, not just the code

The Python codebase enforces its hard-won invariants with tripwires
(AST scanners, registries, pin tests) because Python can't stop the bug
class at the point of writing. The port's bet is that Go can make some
of them **structural**:

| Python lesson (how it's enforced there) | Go shape here |
|---|---|
| Caps are data-driven or they go; every override needs a written why (`test_budget_override_discipline.py` registry) | `budget.Budget{Name, Limit, Why}` — the rationale is a field; a package test fails on any empty `Why` |
| No silent truncation — cuts must be marked (`context_budget.clip` + slice census) | `budget.Clip` is the only shortening idiom; marker byte-identical to Python's so records interoperate |
| No swallowed errors (`except: pass` audits) | errors are returned or recorded; a failed step carries its real reason into the failure chain |
| The resolved store is part of the result (2026-08-16 live-ledger incident) | `record.New(workspaceDir)` takes the store as an argument; `cmd/maro` prints the resolved workspace before any write |
| Data retention: append-only, never auto-delete | `record` has no delete/rotate/compact verbs at all |
| Named agentic seams (`purpose=` on every call) | `llm.Options.Purpose` is on every call site |

## On-disk compatibility

Same workspace resolution as Python `config.workspace_root`, name for
name and in the same order (`MARO_WORKSPACE` > `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE` >
`WORKSPACE_ROOT` > `~/.maro/workspace`; `MARO_USER_DIR` moves only the
user-config tier, and **there is no MARO_HOME** — the 2026-08-16
live-ledger incident variable stays unread). Same record files, same
shapes:

- `memory/outcomes.jsonl` — compatible key subset;
  `measurement_class: "go-port"` fences Go rows in analyses. `cost_usd`
  is deliberately absent (no estimator ported; missing ≠ zero).
- `memory/captains_log.jsonl` — `{timestamp, event_type, subject,
  summary, audience, context, loop_id}`.
- Appends take the same advisory flock on the same sibling
  `<file>.lock` files as Python `file_lock.locked_append` (fail-closed,
  torn-tail framing), so both runtimes can write one workspace without
  corrupting each other's rows.

dev-recall, the viz server, and the learning pipeline read both
runtimes' history through one lens.

## What v0 is (and is not)

**Ported and running (spine-first vertical slice):**

- `internal/config` — two-tier YAML (user < workspace), one-level-deep
  nested merge, env path overrides; parse failures are *reported*, never
  swallowed.
- `internal/budget` — the caps discipline (see doctrine).
- `internal/llm` — adapter seam + `claude` CLI subprocess backend
  (flag-for-flag with the Python adapter, stream-json result parsing)
  and Anthropic Messages API backend; scripted `Fake` for tests/dry-run.
- `internal/jsonx` — tolerant JSON extraction (fences, prose,
  brackets-inside-strings), strict about content (non-string steps
  error, never coerce).
- `internal/planner` — decompose with operator docs
  (GOALS/CONTEXT/SIGNALS.md) riding whole under the OperatorDoc budget.
- `internal/loop` — decompose → execute → record, prior-step evidence
  budgeted+marked, blocked reasons traveling whole.
- `cmd/maro` — `maro run "goal" [-max-steps N] [-backend ...] [-model X]`.

**Deliberately NOT ported yet (next tranches, in rough order of value):**

1. Tool-bearing worker steps (v0 runs `--tools ""` — the safe utility
   mode; real work needs the worker tool protocol).
2. Retry/re-decompose ladder (`loop_blocked`'s decision algorithm).
3. Memory recall + knowledge injection (lessons, playbook, edges).
4. Closure verification / quality gate.
5. Director, intent routing, NOW-vs-AGENDA lanes.
6. Inspector/evolver self-improvement loop.
7. Heartbeat, projects, escalation, notifications, viz.

**Named smaller gaps, accepted for v0** (adversarial round 2026-08-22 —
4 lenses, sonnet-medium fallback; each of these was flagged and either
fixed or parked here honestly):

- Subprocess liveness/stall kill: only the wall-clock timeout exists;
  Python `_run_subprocess_safe`'s mtime/CPU-stall detection is not
  ported. Output capture is disk-backed, so memory stays bounded.
- `cost_usd` estimation: rows omit the field rather than lie `0.0`.
- `config.Get` type mismatches beyond int↔float fall back to the
  default silently (same as Python); a warnings channel like `Load`'s
  is deferred until a caller needs it.
- `Result.Warnings` (record-write failures, unparseable result-shaped
  lines) reach the operator via the CLI's stderr print only — there is
  no durable warnings sink. Deliberate, not deferred laziness: the
  warning's usual cause is a failing store write, and any durable sink
  would live in that same workspace, so "durably record that the store
  is failing, in the store" cannot be honest. A headless supervisor
  should capture stderr; the code comments now claim exactly this much
  and no more (adversarial r3 2026-08-22, Skeptic).
- `jsonx` with NO fence present still takes the first balanced bracket
  in prose — shared verbatim with Python `_find_json_bounds`; fixing it
  is a cross-runtime change, not a Go patch.

## Running

```sh
cd go
go test ./...
go build ./cmd/maro

# Safe smoke against a scratch workspace:
MARO_WORKSPACE=/tmp/maro-go-smoke ./maro run "say hi" -backend dry

# Real run (claude CLI backend, writes to the resolved workspace —
# the first output line SAYS which):
./maro run "summarize the difference between a breaker and a truncator" -max-steps 3
```

## Branch mechanics

Branch `go-port`, worktree `../maro-wt-goport`, pushed with plain
`git push origin go-port` — `scripts/land.sh` is main-only and this
branch does not land to main.
